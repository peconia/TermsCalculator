# Terms Calculator

This is a little Windows WPF application to add or remove service charge or discount and VAT on amounts.
The intended use is to enter an amount and the service charge/discount and VAT percentage, and then
calculate the amount without the terms and VAT, the terms and VAT amounts, and the amount with terms and 
VAT included. So it can be used to either add or remove terms and VAT.

I am building this to learn some C#.
